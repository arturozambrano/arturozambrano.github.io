# Personal Statement 
## (not really a part of the CV)
---

My motivation to be a teacher in software engineering is to advance the
understanding of my students of such a significant topic. For doing that I am
based not only  in my academic background but also in my field experience in
different software development projects. My teaching experiences have always
reinforced how much I enjoy helping people comprehend and apply the concepts
surrounding better ways to build software.

Currently I am professor assistant in two universities with  more than 15 years
of experience in both grad and undergrad courses. My Phd was done in the area of
software engineering, in particular in modularity applying aspect oriented
programming concepts to the software development life cycle. Besides my
experience in the academia I have an equally strong participation in projects in
the industry for a variety of domains. This background includes: embedded
software, slot machines and casino accounting, digital tv and more recently
source code analysis tools for semi-automatic documentation and migration of
legacy systems.

I consider my participation in both academia and industry a significant plus for
my students. Most of what is taught in the academia will ultimately be applied
in the industry, therefore, having hands on experience there is paramount. On
the other hand, having an academic/research approach to problems helped me to
solve complex problems in the field. Feedback from the industry to the academia
materialize as research topics derived from real problems, or the possibility of
validating proposed solution in concrete industrial scenarios, which is really
welcome by the research community.

It is extremely important for me that  students not only understand the subjects
I teach them but be able to use them in their daily life. My goal is for
students to grow as critical and independent thinkers, I want them to have the
tools which will allow them to discern between different possible solution to a
given problem.

### Teaching 
 
ToDo: more work on this

Learning is  a process performed by the student where the teacher takes an
active role engaging and providing guidance. Having many years as lecturer in
object oriented programming at graduated and undergrad levels, I have learnt and
practiced a wide variety of pedagogical tools. Besides the details explained
below, I am passionate about transmitting the importance of the subjects I teach
for the practical future daily work life of my students. I accomplish this by
being specially careful regarding the examples and the scenarios for the
assignment, lab works and exams.

This message reaches my students and they appreciate the effort I invest in my
teaching activities, as I have been consistently ranked above the media. My
courses are considered by students as really influential and inspiring, as
reflected by the polls taken every year by Universidad Nacional de Quilmes.

#### Graduate and Undergrad Teaching at University of La Plata

University of La Plata is the third university in Argentina  according to
international rankings. Every year 800 students enroll for the different
computer science careers offered by the Computer Science Faculty.

My courses cover from basic object oriented programming concept to more advanced
topics such as reflection and aspect oriented programming. These courses are a
requirement for the second and third year of the Licenciatura en Informática  (5
years degree in computer science) and Computer Science Engineering.

As lecturer I am part of a team composed by 3 professors, 3 lecturers and 12
teaching assistants. Annually the basic OOP course accounts for 400 students,
and around 100 for the more advanced one. My contribution has not only to do
with contents of  practical assignments, but also with the coordination of such
a big team. Part of this coordination consist on regular performance evaluation
and improvements, along with definition of a unified criteria in order keep the
team's message consistent.

Our courses are taught organized as follows:
- Theoretic lectures in charge of full professors.
- Practical lectures in charge of lecturers.
- Hands on work lectures in the lab where teaching assistants help students to
  complete their practical assignments.
- Homework submitted through an online platform
- At the end of the course there is one examination to determine if the student
  has passed or not the course. This examination plus her performance in the
  assignments determine their final mark.

I am responsible for assignment contents, practical lectures and exams at the
end of the semester. I am also in charge of some theoretic lectures for specific
topics assigned by the full-professors.

Besides these two undergrad courses, I have taught OOP as part of the Master in
Software Engineering program. In this course I have been responsible also for
theoretic content.



####  Undergrad Teaching at University of Quilmes

Computer Science department of U. of Quilmes (UNQ for short) is relatively new,
account for 10 years. I have been part of the department team almost since its
creation. It is a dynamic environment with two careers in computer science.

During my first year at UNQ I taught OOP. Then I accepted the challenge of creating a
course from scratch on on Digital TV and Streaming technologies. Two years later
I have had the opportunity to create a new course for student on the final year.
The idea was to prepare them in those technologies and tools currently used in
the industry.

I was in charge of designing the syllabus of the course and practical
assignments. The course entitled: "Cloud based services" cover the following
topics:
- Asynchronous programming model (callbacks, futures, promises, async/await)
- REST APIs 
- Containers as an introduction to micro-services technology.


Along this course the students learn to work with Node Js and they connect with
public REST APIs of well known services such as Spotify, MusixMatch, Google,
etc.

Every year 50 students take this course. It is considered by the students as one
of the most inspiring and they have  requested to make it mandatory due to the
relevance they perceive of it. Besides this, it has been consistently ranked in
top three courses by the department.


## Research Interests
My primary research interest is in the area of modularity. Complex systems
composed by a myriad of concerns ask for better mechanisms to express those
concerns in an as isolated manner as possible. 

In my PhD, I have studied in depth the implications of using aspect oriented
software development through several steps in the software development lifecycle
for an industrial case study. 
 This work documents how 
interactions rise between different components leading to undesired behavior. From this
analysis I have derived new forms to deal, express and control such
interactions during requirement engineering, modeling and programming stages at software development.

Another related topic is expressiveness of programming languages. I worked
on better ways to improve it through domain specific languages. 

As part of an industrial project I developed real-time visualization engine 
for data coming from Twitter. I have combined this with previously expressed interest
in language expressiveness. The result is a live environment where a DSL
allows for the modification 'on the fly' of a pipeline for the real time analysis 
of a data stream (taking Twitter again as a first example). This work is the main topic 
of my current master student. We are currently in the process of publishing the results.
